MALLOC:
  This is my version of the malloc, calloc, realloc and free functions. 

Prototypes:
  void *malloc(size_t size);
  void free(void *ptr);
  void *calloc(size_t nmeb, size_t size);
  void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);

Description :  
  - malloc allows you to allocate 'size' bytes and returns a pointer 
    to the allocated memory.
  - free allow you to free the memory space pointed by 'ptr'.
  - calloc same behaviour as malloc, parameters are differents, it allocates
    memory for an aray of size 'nmeb' of 'size' bytes each. Memory is set to
    zero.
  - realloc change the size of a previously allocated memoryspace

How to use:
  To build the library simply use the make command. You will get libmalloc.so
  then you have to change $LB_LIBRARY_PATH to the path to libmalloc.so and 
  then run your applications. This way my implementation is going to 
  overrite the default one.

Implementation:
  My plan is to do a mix between first fit implementation and binary buddies.
